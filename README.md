# Email Spoofer (Proof of Concept)

Spoofs an email with attachment and HTML formatting


![result image](result.png?raw=true)

This tool was built to spoof against a specific mail server that allowed the sending of mail as other users without a login. This is not meant to be a general all-in-one spoofing tool, but may be used to send emails as other users if your targeted email server has that ability.
